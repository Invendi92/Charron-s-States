Narrator: A cat and a bit of poison in a sealed box. Quantum mechanics says that after a while, the cat is both alive and dead. A person looking into the box will either find the cat alive or dead, however it is assumed to be both alive and dead before you look into the box.

Narrator: You found yourself in a Box, you don't see much around you.

[Stays inside thev box]

Narrator: It's starting to get a little crampy around here

Narrator: How about getting some fresh air

[Gets out of the box]
